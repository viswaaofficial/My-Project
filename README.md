# TIC-TAC-TOE
A Simple TIC-TAC-TOE project which is played either between one vs one or one vs computer. The game is played on a three by three board. 

#Project Description:
The problem is to design a virtual version game of Tic-Tac-Toe which is played either between one vs one or one vs computer. 
The game is played on a three by three board. Each player will be assigned a mark. One player will be assigned  'X', the other  ‘O’. 
Players alternate turns to place their marker on the board. 
The first player to get three in a row either diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, wins the games. 
In the event all squares are taken on the board without a winner then it is a tie. 
The program should set up the game by asking for the names of the players and also it must include one vs computer option too. 
Then they would asked to select how many rounds they want to play this game and display that information about the result at the end of each game. 
The program should display winner of each game at the end of the game itself. 
It should count the games won by each player without considering draw matches and should declare the winner as the most won player out of two and congratulate the winner. 
If the information provided by the user at any stage of the program is invalid, the program should re-prompt until valid information is provided.
